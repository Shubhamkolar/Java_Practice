Q: When should you extend the Thread class and when should you implement the Runnable interface?
=> In most cases, it is recommended to implement the Runnable interface rather than extending the Thread class. This is because:

1. Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. So, if you extend the Thread class, your class cannot extend any other class, which can be a limitation.
2. By implementing Runnable, you separate the task (logic) from the execution mechanism (the Thread class), which follows better design principles like separation of concerns.
3. It also promotes code reusability and makes your class more flexible and testable.

Extend the Thread class only when you need to override methods in the Thread class or need more control over thread behavior, which is rare.
