A collection allows a group of objects to be treated as a single unit.
The Java Collection Framework provides a set of standard utility classes for managing
various kinds of collections. The core framework is provided in the java.util package 
and comprises three main parts:
1. The core interfaces
2. A set of implementations (concrete classes) that are specific implementations of the 
   core interfaces.
3. Static utility methods found in the Collections and Arrays classes that can be used to 
   perform various operations on collections and arrays, such as sorting and searching, or 
   creating customized collections.


CORE INTERFACES:
The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface that specifies an iterator to
sequentially access the elements of an Iterable object.
